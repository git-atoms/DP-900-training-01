- 👋 Hi, I’m @git-atoms (Tomasz Sliwinski)
- 👀 I’m interested in to get to know something new every day
- 🌱 I’m currently learning creating RWD websites, RegEx, MS SQL, PowerBI, Python...
- 💞️ At this moment, I’m looking for collaboration with someone serious and responsible in Poland, who wants to improve own skills together. Perhaps in the future, we both will design and create own company (great things have small beginnings).
- 📫 How to reach me ... (I leave here contact to me very soon)
